# Runtime enviroments for JavaScript

Javascript is a programming language that nowadays can be used for many purposes in web development. In the frontend side, we use the browser to execute or JS scripts, and this is how it has been done since its birth. However it can be used for backend development as well with the help of **Node.js**, which is a runtime enviroment for JavaScript to be able to run in from the terminal. 

When creating web apps we have to be wise on how to link JavaScript files with HTML and CSS. It is not feasible to do everything from the browser, instead we work on three separate files for HTML, CSS and JS. 

A standard route for a web app project looks like this

```
project/
    index.html
    style.css
    script.js
```
Having a separate file for stylesheets and scripts, especially when these files have a lot of lines of code, is the best practice for developers, because it provides for a cleaner organization of the project and it is easier to debug.
