# JavaScript Origin

Before JavaScript, webpages were not dynamic at all. Basically every website in the 90s was static, and users could not directly interact with browsers. 

JavaScript was originally develop to work in the browsers in order to tackle this problem. It is fully oriented to work in web development. It is also object oriented and weakly typed and dynamic.

- **Object oriented:** JavaScript works heavily with objects, and we will see later that this is one of the major usages of the language. We can store information via objects, and creating instances to work with them.

- **Weakly typed:** JavaScript can work with operations between different dataypes, which many programming languages do not have at all. This language is capable of determining a logical operations between variables of differente dataypes in order to give us a coherent output. 

- **Dynamic:** When we work with a programming language there are always two main stages: compilation and runtime execution. When we talk about compilation it means that local machines translate our language into machine code (byte code). After this, an `.exe` file is generated, and this will be the one that will execute the program. 

    With JavaScript this does not happen, because it is a dynamic language. Instead it directly runs in the runtime execution, we just open it in the browser to see the output. 

    Now the question might arise, if JavaScript is an interpreted language. Well technically yes, even though it does not rigorously follow the definition of interpreted language. 

    JavaScript runs in sometime known as a browser engine. This is a JIT compiler that translates into machine code, which is given to the browser to display the output in screen. 

Javascript is also ***backwards compatible***, which means that every new modules that are release to newer version of the language will not break older codes, however they cannot be used in the current enviroment ruintime.
