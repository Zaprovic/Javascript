# Arrays

This is an ordered data structure, also known as *list* in which we can store variables of different dataypes. 

    var a = [1,2,3,"Hello",true];   

In order to access the elements of an arary we use **index notation**, which starts counting from 0 to retrieve the value in specified position

    console.log(a[0]);   // Returns 1
    console.log(a[3]);   // Returns "Hello

Arrays have some built in methods in order to acces useful information about them

- `a.length` will return the lenght of the array
-
