# Operators

These are what we use to perform logical expressions between variables

#### Binary operators
Some of these are can be applied not only to numbers. This has to do with coercion and the fact that JavaScript is weakly typed. 

- `+` can be used for concatenation
- `-`
- `*`
- `/`

#### Unitary operators

- `!`

#### Assignment operators

### Comparison operators
- `=` used to assign a variable to specified value
- `==` only compares the value of variables
- `===` compares both value and type
- `>` `>=`
- `<` `<=`
- `&&` returns `true` if and only if all the statements are `true`
- `||` returns `true` if at least one of the statements is `true`

#### Increment operator
- `++` increments by 1
- `+=` increments by specified amount
