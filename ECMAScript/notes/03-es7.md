# ECMAScript 7

This update was released in June 2016. It is not as big as ES6, but it has some interesting features

## Exponentiation operator
We can raise a number to a specific power by using `**` . Notice that this is the same exponentiation operator as in Python. 

## Array include
A new array method called `includes()` was added to this version. It determines whether an array (or a string) includes a particular element, returning a boolean value as an output.

- `myVariable.includes(a,b)` Where `a` is the element to compare and `b` the initial index from which the comparison will start.
