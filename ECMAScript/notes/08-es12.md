# ECMAScript 12

## Numeric separators
It is a very little update, but it was gamechanging. Numeric separators allow for a better number display. It is obvious that trying to read a number like 239485739457398902321342 becomes an overwhelming thing to do. Instea we can separate every three space like `const a = 239_485_739_457_398_902_321_342`. The output in the console will still look the same but the importat thing here is that we can manipulate and have better insights of what is the order of magnitudes we are working with.

## `replaceAll()`
This is a method that receives a string, and returns a new string by replacing *all of the elements for other*

```
const message = "JavaScript is an awesome language, and with JavaScript I can make backend development";

message.replace("JavaScript","Python");   //"Python is an awesome language, and with JavaScript I can make backend development"

message.replaceAll("JavaScript","Python");   //"Python is an awesome language, and with Python I can make backend development"
```

## `Promise.any()`
Promises became a fundamental thing in JavaScript since their development in ECMAScript6, and they have had an important role in the development of asynchronous programming. `Promise.any()` is another way to handle various promises, but it will return *the very first promise that is resolved*, and will reboot if all the promises are rejected. 


```
const data = [
	{
		id: 1,
		title: "Iron Man",
		year: 2008,
	},
	{
		id: 2,
		title: "Spiderman Homecoming",
		year: 2017,
	},
	{
		id: 3,
		title: "Avengers : Endgame",
		year: 2019,
	},
];

const titles = ["Iron Man", "Spiderman Homecoming"];

const dataGetter = (d, titles) => {
	const promises = titles.map((title) => {
		return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
			setTimeout(() => {
				const result = d.find((item) => {
					return item.title === title;
				});

				if (result) {
					resolve(result);
				} else {
					reject("No title found");
				}
			}, 1500);
		});
	});

	return Promise.any(promises);
};

const out = async () => {
	try {
		const getResult = await Promise.all([dataGetter(data, titles)]);
		console.log(getResult[0]);
	} catch (e) {
		console.log(e);
	} finally {
		console.log("Promise settled");
	}
};

out();

```

This is the exact same code as before, but instead of using `Promise.all()` in the return statement of `dataGetter()` , we are using `Promise.any()`

This will return the very first promise that resolves, and in the case all were rejected the output will look like this

```
[AggregateError: All promises were rejected] {
  [errors]: [ 'No title found', 'No title found' ]
}
```

## Private methods
In OOP, we usually deal with many classes in different files and packages. Most of the time we do not want to allow  external users to be able to directly change the attributes of instances of a class, and instead we add getter and setter methods. Some strongly object oriented languages like Java or C++ can make sure no one access attribute instances directly by making them as private using special keywords. In ES12 this feature was introduced by using the symbol `#` before a declaration

```
class Car {
	#brand;
	#mode;
	#year;

	constructor(brand, model, year) {
		this.#brand = brand;
		this.#model = model;
		this.#year = year;
	}

	get model() {
		return this.#brand;
	}

    set model(model){
        this.#model = model
    }
}
```
This way all the attributes of any instance of class `Car` cannot be changed directly, so for example trying to do `car1.model = "A6"` is not possible. This has to do with the fundamental pillars of object oriented programming, more especifically encapsulation. A good object oriented code has an implementation of getter and setter functions that allow users to change the attributes of an instance, rather than changing its value by accesing them directly.
