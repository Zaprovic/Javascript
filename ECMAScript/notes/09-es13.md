## `at`
It is an array method that is used to access their elements by index.

```
const a = ["JavaScript","MySQL","Python","PHP"];

console.log(a.at(-1)) // Returns PHP
console.log(a.at(-2)) // Returns Python
console.log(a.at(-3)) // Returns MySQL
```

This is very useful when we want to acces the last items of the array, when its lenght its not known, because `.at()` accepts for negative numbers, unlike bracket notation
