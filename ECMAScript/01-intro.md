# How was JavaScript born

During the latest 50s, computing was being developed exhaustively. The first machines and programming languages were born. Years laters, in 1969, ARPANET was created, but it wasn't until 1990 that the World Wide Web was established complelety. 

This was a major grounbreaking moment, beacuse from that moment any person in the world could access to information in the web. In 1993 MOSAIC was born, consolidating itself as the first browser in computing history. 

Other major browsers were developed after this, such as Opera and NetScape . At the time, Microsoft did not wanted to be ahead of competitors, so they developed Internet Explorer. All this browser war generated some very interesting and nowadays fundamental technologies such as CSS. 

But it wasn't until 1195 that Brandon Eich created one of the fundamental pilars in todays web development: JavaScript. At first, the name it took was Moca, then LiveScript and at the end it has the name we now today. 

Microsoft actually developed its own scripting language at the time, named JScript. This was just the beginning of other techonology war to determine which company would have the best scripting language. To prevent that, in 1997, the ECMA (European Computer Manufacturer Association) created a standard in order to regulate features and how they affects scripting languages. 

## Evolution of JavaScript
Due to the ECMA standards, JavaScript has been able to develop in a very concise form. From 1997 various versions were released. 

- 1997 ES1
- 1998 ES2
- 1999 ES3
- 2000 ES4
- 2005 ES5
- 2015 ES6
- 2016 ES7
- 2017 ES8
- 2018 ES9
- 2019 ES10


## TC39
The TC39 is a group of developers that make all the JavaScript updates, under the regulation of ECMA of course. 

Any person can actually make contributions to TC39 in order to develop JavaScript. But there are some guidelines to follow: 

- **Stage 0:** Strawperson
- **Stage 1:** Proposal
- **Stage 2:** Draft
- **Stage 3:** Candidate
- **Stage 4:** Finished

If there is an idea that passes all the stages, ECMAScript will always announce the updates in the month of June.
